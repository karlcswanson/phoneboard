## Controlling Phoneboard
![phoneboard control](docs/img/controls.png)

<kbd>l</kbd> brings up the main controls for phoneboard.  Groups of codecs and calls can be controlled with OFF-AIR, Queue, and ON-AIR.

* **OFF-AIR** - Set all channels to OFF-AIR.  This ends any existing codec calls and Twilio conferences.  Callers are instructed to redial 15 minutes before the conference.
* **Queue** - Opens up lines.  Callers are prompted for a room to join and placed on hold once the conference starts.
* **ON-AIR** - Set all channels to ON-AIR.  If disconnected, codecs will redial.

### Manual Controls
There are additional manual controls for phoneboard.  These are available for testing individual codec and Twilio API functions.  These can be accessed by pressing <kbd>e</kbd>.

* **ON AIR** - Dials the codec and redials once a call is dropped.

##### Codec Controls
* **call** - Set codec to dial.
* **drop** - set codec to drop call.

Clicking `codec` opens the codec management page.

## Call Monitoring
Using the Twilio WebRTC API, calls can be monitored within phoneboard.  Pressing <kbd>1</kbd>...<kbd>8</kbd> or clicking on the ON-AIR text will dial into the corresponding conference.  ðŸŽ· indicates a current WebRTC call.

On mobile devices, clicking **Live** and **Delay** dials the conference line for monitoring.

## Switchboard
Switchboard is a separate web server that serves TwiML for Twilio.  The Twilio service submits data to switchboard via a POST request.  TwiML supplied by Switchboard directs Twilio on how to route calls from the JK Audio codecs and phone calls to the DID numbers.
